<p>A while back I backed a Kickstarter project called DreamScreen. The project was
to build a box the would add LED light behind your TV that &ldquo;extended&rdquo; what was
on the TV. It got enough backers and they actually shipped out the boxes. You
put an LED strip around the back of the TV, and then plugged that strip into
the box they built. You then plugged your TV source (Apple TV for me) into the
box and the box into the TV.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years and it eventually stopped working. The company that
had formed around the project was gone at that point and so you couldn&rsquo;t really
get replacements. Maybe you could find one on eBay, but their mobile app to
control the device had also stopped working. At the time I looked around for an
alternative device, but I never really found a good one for my needs.</p>
<p>Fast forward again and I noticed a post on /r/appletv about a setup that looked
exactly like my DreamScreen setup. I had really enjoyed my DreamScreen so I
started looking into the setup. The author had written up a detailed post on
how he got it all working so I had everything I needed. The first thing to
check was if I could use my same LEDs. He was using WS2812b LEDs and the LEDs
that came with my DreamScreen were SK6812 LEDs. They were compatible! I also
found details on the connector that DreamScreen had shipped with and I could
wire things up.</p>
<p>With all the details and the hardware mentioned in the post I set out on
building a DreamScreen replacement. Andrew, the author of the project, did a
great job documenting things and I had a working system in no time! Now I can
enjoy the same effects of DreamScreen even though that project is dead.</p>
